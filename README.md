# nightbot-gw2
Guild Wars 2 commands for nightbot.

When this project gets closer to production ready, I will be hosting a version of this on [http://gw2.ninja](GW2.Ninja) for everyone to use.

NOTE: This project is **not** production ready yet. *All* the code is subject to change at any point. 

## API

- [ ] WvW Rank
- [ ] Account Name
- [ ] Current Server

## Future

The plan is to get this running with a PHP Framework at some point. Currently looking at [https://lumen.laravel.com/](Lumen) for this, due to it's simplicity. 

Nightbot also provides these cool animated overlays for your stream. It might be added onto this project at some point, to provide similar overlays through the browser plugin for OBS Studio. For now, this project will be mostly for custom commands with Nightbot.
